# Deque-Tookit
This project implements a deque container in C++ using a dynamic array of arrays to store elements. The deque supports operations like push_front, pop_front, push_back, pop_back, front, back, empty, size, and array-like access using operator[].

# How To Start
Step 1. Make
Step 2. ./deque
Step 3. Look at the code, as I am unsure if you're even meant to see what it does?

# Deque Functionality
Constructor: Initializes an empty deque.
Destructor: Deletes both dimensions of the deque.
push_front(value): Adds an element to the front of the deque.
pop_front(): Removes an element from the front of the deque.
push_back(value): Adds an element to the back of the deque.
pop_back(): Removes an element from the back of the deque.
front(): Returns a copy of the first element.
back(): Returns a copy of the last element.
empty(): Returns true if the deque is empty, false otherwise.
size(): Returns the number of elements in the deque.
operator: Provides array-like access to elements.

# Difficulties
This was really difficult to do, as I, Xander Butler, the one writing this, had no real idea what to do here. I feel like I made all of what's necessary, as I had to do extensive research into how this stuff works, but also my partner for this assignment has been too busy with her own course load to offer me any assistance, so I have no idea on if what I made is any good. As I have the functions, but don't know if they work or what to do with them.
